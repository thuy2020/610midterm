(10 points) Use the function above to download all the data from 2014-15 to 17-18 to each of the past 4 school years and bind it into a single data frame, using a single function (i.e., one line of code). Note, this may take a minute or two to run, depending on your Internet speed.

Conduct some basic data cleaning to make your data file look like the following.

Filter for only student groups coded as "White" or "Hispanic/Latino".
Select variables related to the number of students in each of the levels (1:4), and not percentages or collapsed levels.
Remove any row that has missing data in any of the n variables

```{r}

data <- map_df(15:18, download_file)

d <- data %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  filter(student_group == "White" |
        student_group == "Hispanic/Latino") %>% 
  select(academic_year, district, school, student_group, grade_level, number_level_1, number_level_2, number_level_3, number_level_4) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(number_level_1, number_level_2, number_level_3, number_level_4),
            names_to = "level",
            names_prefix = "number_level_",
            values_to = "n") %>% 
  drop_na(n) 
head(d)
```

2. (10 points) Collapse (sum) the n across grades and school for each district within each academic year, student group, and level. At the same time, calulate the number of schools (unique schools listed) for each district. Also move your data to a wider format where the student groups become new columns, filled by the district n. Remove districts that did not report numbers for one or both student groups (i.e., drop missing data from the new columns). Your data frame should look like the below

```{r}

d <- d %>% 
  group_by(district) %>% # how to retain column n_school from here?
  mutate(n_school = length(unique(school))) %>% 
  group_by(academic_year, district, student_group, n_school, level) %>% 
  summarise(tol_n = sum(n)) %>% 
  

  pivot_wider(names_from = student_group, 
           values_from = tol_n) %>% 
  drop_na(White) %>% 
  drop_na(`Hispanic/Latino`) %>% 
  clean_names() 

```

Part B: Achievement gaps
30 points

(10 points) Estimate an achievement gap effect size for every school district in the state that reported data on both student groups (i.e., using the data we created above), for each academic year. Note, on my computer this took about 38 seconds. It will likely take a bit longer for you, but shouldn’t take too long. You may get a warning. Just go ahead and ignore that for now.

```{r}
#remotes::install_github("datalorax/gapr") 
library(gapr)
# ashland_middle_g6 <- oregon_schools[1:4, ]
# estimate_v(ashland_middle_g6, "white", "hispanic_latino")

d <- d %>% 
  group_by(academic_year, district) %>% 
  nest() %>% 
  mutate(mod = map(data, ~ estimate_v("white", "hispanic_latino", data = .x)))

v <- d %>% 
  select(-data) %>% 
  unnest(mod)
head(v)
```

(10 points) The plot below shows the achievement gap estimate for one school district across years. Produce a similar plot to the below for each of the first 100 school districts. Make sure you don’t miss the caption noting the number of schools in the district.

```{r}
dists <- unique(v$district)[1:100]

dp <- v %>% 
  filter(district %in% dists)

# first try district Adrian SD 61

dp %>% 
  filter(district == "Adrian SD 61") %>% 
ggplot(aes(academic_year, v)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(aes(x = as.numeric(as.factor(academic_year)))) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = v - v_se, ymax = v + v_se), color = "grey") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0,
             color = "red") +
  labs(x = "School year",
       y = "Average Achievement Difference (SD Unites)", 
       title = "Achievement Gap Estimates: Adrian SD 61 District",
      subtitle = "Negative values indicate White students have higher average achievement\n Positive values indicate Hispanic/Latino students have higher average achievement",
       caption = "Note: District includes 3 schools") +
  theme_minimal()

```

HINTS

You don’t have to use a loop to create the file names (maybe give {glue} a try? Otherwise paste or paste0 will work fine).
When working with the code, limit the number of plots you’re saving to, say, the first five to make sure it works before running it on all plots.

```{r}
# plot for all districts
library(glue)

p <- d %>% 
  group_by(district) %>% 
  nest() %>% 
  mutate(plot = map2(data, district, ~
      ggplot(.x, aes(academic_year, v)) +
      geom_point() +
  geom_line(aes(x = as.numeric(as.factor(academic_year)))) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = v - v_se, ymax = v + v_se), color = "grey") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0,
             color = "red") +
    labs(x = "School year",
       y = "Average Achievement Difference (SD Unites)",
      title = glue("Achievement Gap Estimates: {.y}"), 
      subtitle = "Negative values indicate White students have higher average achievement\n Positive values indicate Hispanic/Latino students have higher average achievement",
       caption = "Note: District includes 3 schools") +
  theme_minimal()
      ))

p$plot[[1]]
